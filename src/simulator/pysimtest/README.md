# Pysimtest
Pysimtest is a uwsim simulation testing framework, based on the Java JUnit as well as the python unittest testing frameworks.

Pysimtest provides a pythonic solution for simple modular testing of ai algorithms using the uwism simulation environment. It offers a high-level interface to easily change the simulation by modifying scene parameters, setting the vehicle's initial pose, and adding multiple objects at varying positions.

## Creating Test Suites
To create a valid simulation test suite using pysimtest, you must adhere to certain conventions. First, make a python module `my_test_module.py` and store it in the`simtests` package under `Jormungandr/src/simulator`. Next, import `pysimtest` and make a class `MyTestSuite` which extends `pysimtest.SimTestSuite`.  If you decide that you want to set parameters which will apply to all test cases in your suite, you can do so by overriding the abstract `forall` method. Remember to decorate the `forall` method with the `@pysimtest.forall` decorator for it to properly work.  Any parameter set in the `forall` method will be automatically applied to each test case.  To create a valid test, define a function `test_certain_condition` and wrap it with the `@pysimtest.test(run=True)` decorator. Note that a valid test must start with the string 'test' and be wrapped with the decorator.  Set the parameters for the test case by calling any of the functions defined below, remembering to call them using `self`. You can use the test decorator's `run` parameter to make the test run or not. You may define multiple test suites in the same module (i.e having `MyOtherTestSuite` also in `my_test_module.py`) and run them all using a single command.

## Running Test Suites
There are two ways to run a test suite, for both, make sure you have `roscore` running.
- 1.  Navigate to `Jormungandr/src/simulator/pysimtest` and execute the following on the command line: `python pysimtest.py my_test_module.py`
- 2. Source the shell script `pysimtest.sh` found in `Jormungandr/src/simulator/pysimtest`, or add it to your `.bashrc`, and enter the command `pysimtest my_test_module.py`. This option works from any directory.

Once you run your test suite, the terminal will notify you which test in which suite is currently running. To stop a test and continue onto the next one, you can enter `Ctrl`+`C` into the terminal. For troubleshooting, make sure `roscore` is running and try closing the current terminal and use a new one.

## Code Documentation

### Decorators
- `@pysimtest.forall`: If overriding the `forall` method, wrap it in this decorator
- `@pysimtest.test(run=True)`: Wrap all test methods with this decorator. Use the `run` parameter to specifiy if you want the test to run or not

### Functions
- `SimTestSuite.add_pool()`: Spawns a large pool in the simulation.
- `SimTestSuite.add_seafloor()`: Spawns the seafloor in the simulation.
- `SimTestSuite.add_pole(x, y, z)`: Spawns a pole in the simulation at the position x,y,z.
- `SimTestSuite.add_gate(x_pos, y_pos, z_pos, r_rot, p_rot, y_rot)`: Spawns a gate in the simulation at the position x,y,z with orientation r,p,y (in radians).
- `SimTestSuite.add_path_marker(x_pos, y_pos, z_pos, r_rot, p_rot, y_rot)`: Spawns a path marker in the simulation at the position x,y,z with orientation r,p,y (in radians).
- `SimTestSuite.add_dice(x_pos, y_pos, z_pos, r_rot, p_rot, y_rot)`: Spawns a dice in the simulation at the position x,y,z with orientation r,p,y (in radians).
- `SimTestSuite.set_wave_scale(scale)`: Sets the wave scale for the simulation. Note that the actual scale factor is of the form 1x10^-(scale), and that the default value is 1x10^-7. As such, calling this function with a value of less than 7 will increase the waves' height.
- `SimTestSuite.set_timeout(secs)`: Sets the timeout length for a test case.  After the timeout length passes, the next test, if any, will run. The default value is 60 seconds.
- `SimTestSuite.set_vehicle_position(x, y, z)`: Sets the vehicle's initial position to be x,y,z.
- `SimTestSuite.set_vehicle_rotation(r, p, y)`: Sets the vehicle's initial orientation to by r,p,y (in radians).

### Behind the Scenes
Pysimtest's internal framework is largely based upon python's unittest library. When you run `pysimtest.py`, the main program is run, which has two stages, loading and executing. The loader searches for the python module that the main program was given as an argument, and once it finds it, it collects instances of all classes in the module that extend `pysimtest.SimTestSuite`. Then, for each test suite instance, the loader searches among the instance's methods for a `forall` method. If it finds it, and it has been properly decorated, it calls it, which uses the decorator to internally sets the 'global' parameters for the test suite. Once it has done this, the loader searches for all methods that start with the string 'test', and if they are properly decorated, it calls them. The `test` decorator uses a builder to set up the objects needed for a test case before the user's test method is called, and sets their global parameters, if any.   The test method then appropriately sets the parameters for the newly built test case, and at the end, the decorator configures the test case and adds it to the test suite's collection of test cases. After this has been done for all test suites, they have been properly loaded, and can now be executed. The loader uses the runner to execute tests in each suite. It first tells the runner to launch the simulation ai, then, for every test suite, it loops over the suite's test cases and sends its data to the runner. The runner configures the xml document which describes the uwsim scene with the given data, and then executes the uwsim program with this xml document.
